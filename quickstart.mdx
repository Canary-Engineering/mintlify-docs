## Before You Start

<Info>
Read these prerequisites before connecting or flashing.
</Info>

### Bench Unlock (MG1 / MD1)

B58 Gen1 (MG1), B58 Gen2 (MG1CS024), and S58 (MD1) ECUs require a **one-time bench unlock** before OBD flashing is possible. This is a physical step performed by a tuner or specialist. If your ECU is not bench-unlocked, flashing will fail.

### ROM Database

The ECU's exact hardware and software identifiers must be in the ROM whitelist. Unknown ROMs are rejected by default. If you see "Unknown ROM", your ECU may need to be added to the ROM database. See [Troubleshooting](/guides/troubleshooting) for details.

### Backup Requirement

**Always create and verify a backup before your first flash.** The flash flow will not proceed unless a valid backup exists. Store backups in a safe location.

## Step 1: Connect the Adapter

1. **WiFi adapter** (MHD WiFi, ENET cable):
   - Connect your phone to the adapter's WiFi network
   - Default IP: `192.168.4.1`, Port: `6801`
   - In the app: **Settings** → **Connection** → enter IP and port → **Connect**

2. **Verify connection**:
   - The connection status dot in the app header turns green when connected
   - The **Tune** tab shows your ECU info (VIN snippet, engine family, SW version)

## Step 2: Create a Backup

1. Open the **Restore** tab
2. Tap **Create Backup**
3. Confirm the operation
4. Wait for the backup to complete (progress bar)
5. Backups are stored in the app's documents directory (path shown after completion)

<Warning>
Do not skip this step. A backup is required before flashing.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Flash a Tune

1. Open the **Tune** tab
2. Configure flash options (throttle, exhaust, performance, etc.) as desired
3. Tap the **Flash** button (FAB)
4. In the confirmation sheet: select stage, octane, transmission
5. Tap **Confirm** to start the flash
6. Keep the engine off, ignition on. A battery charger is recommended for long operations.
7. Do not disconnect or put the device to sleep during the flash
