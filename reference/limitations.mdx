## Protocol Support

- **UDS**: Implemented with full response validation
- **KWP2000**: Modeled for N54 (MSD80/81) but not implemented. Types exist in `apex-uds::kwp2000`.

## Adapter Support

- **WiFi / ENET**: HSFZ over TCP, implemented
- **FTDI**: Behind feature `serial`; stub without it (mobile builds)
- **LegacyWifi**: Modeled, no implementation

## Hardware Testing

- **Zero bytes to real ECU**: All 556 tests use mocks. Not validated on real vehicles/ECUs.

## Flash Gaps

- Resume-from-exact-last-block: not implemented; full re-transfer on resume
- Bootloader patching: read/validate done; patch application not implemented
- MultiMap RAM addresses: placeholders (0xFFFFFFFF)

## Dangerous Operations

Bootloader writes and unlock/re-lock flows are **library-only**, feature-gated (`dangerous-bootloader-write`, `dangerous-unlock-ops`), and require runtime acknowledgement. The mobile app does not expose these. End users never see them.
