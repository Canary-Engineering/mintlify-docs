## Multi-Map Slots

ECUs with multi-map support (e.g. B58, S58) can store multiple calibration slots. You can switch between them at runtime without reflashing.

- **Slot count**: Typically 4 slots (depends on ECU family)
- **Active slot**: Shown in the **Tune** tab and **Codes** tab

## Switching Maps (App)

1. Open the **Tune** tab
2. Find the map slot pills (Slot 1, 2, 3, 4)
3. **Double-tap** the target slot to switch (safety measure to prevent accidental changes)
4. The ECU switches to the selected map

<Info>
Double-tap is required to confirm. Single tap does not switch.

## Steering Wheel Control

If the **WheelControl** flash option is enabled, you can switch maps using:

- Steering wheel buttons
- Cruise control stalk
- BC (Board Computer) button

The exact controls depend on your vehicle and tune configuration. See your tuner's documentation for details.

## MHD+ Menu System

Some tunes include an MHD+ steering wheel menu for runtime configuration (exhaust flap, CEL pattern, etc.). The menu is navigated via steering wheel buttons. Map slot selection is part of this menu system when supported.
