## Supported Adapters

Apex Flashtool works with adapters that expose BMW **HSFZ** framing over TCP:

| Adapter | Type | Default IP | Port |
|---------|------|------------|------|
| MHD WiFi | WiFi | 192.168.4.1 | 6801 |
| ENET cable | Ethernet | (device IP) | 6801 |

### WiFi Adapter Setup

1. Power on the WiFi OBD adapter and plug it into the OBD-II port
2. On your phone, go to **WiFi settings** and connect to the adapter's network (e.g. "MHD WiFi")
3. Open Apex Flashtool and go to **Settings** → **Connection**
4. Enter the adapter IP (default: `192.168.4.1`) and port (`6801`)
5. Tap **Connect**

### ENET Cable

For F/G-series vehicles with direct Ethernet-to-OBD:

1. Connect the ENET cable to the OBD port and your device (via USB-C Ethernet or similar)
2. The adapter may have a different IP; check the adapter documentation
3. Enter the IP and port (typically 6801) in **Settings** → **Connection**
