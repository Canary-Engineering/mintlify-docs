## Pre-Flash Checklist

Before flashing, ensure:

- **Backup verified**: You have created and verified a backup
- **Battery**: Voltage stable (charger recommended for long operations)
- **Ignition**: On, engine off
- **Connection**: Adapter connected, no sleep during flash
- **Tune file**: Correct size and format for your ECU

The app runs pre-flash condition checks before starting. If any check fails, the flash will not proceed.

## Flash Workflow

1. **Configure options**: Open the **Tune** tab. Adjust flash options (throttle, exhaust, performance, etc.) as desired.
2. **Select tune**: Choose your tune file (.bin). Tune files are obtained from your tuner or OTS map provider.
3. **Tap Flash**: Tap the Flash button (FAB). A confirmation sheet appears.
4. **Confirm**: Select stage, octane, transmission. Tap **Confirm** to start.
5. **Wait**: Do not disconnect or put the device to sleep. A battery charger is recommended.

## Getting Tune Files

Tune files (.bin) are calibration data. You obtain them from:

- **OTS (off-the-shelf) maps**: Pre-built maps from tuners (e.g. Stage 1, Stage 2)
- **Custom tunes**: From your tuner, tailored to your vehicle and modifications

Apex Flashtool does not provide a tune catalog. We document the format and validation only. The file must match your ECU calibration size (e.g. 192 KB for B58 MG1).

## Flash Options

Flash options are applied as patches before writing. Categories include:

- **Exhaust / sound**: Burble, ColdStartReduction, ExhaustFlap, OpfDelete
- **Performance**: VmaxRemoval, BoostPerGear, CoolantTarget, Antilag
- **Throttle**: LinearThrottle, ThrottleLag, PedalMapping
- **Idle / launch**: IdleRpm, LaunchRpm, RevMatch
- **Transmission**: KickdownDisable, ShiftBogFix, TcuLimiterDelete
- **Hardware**: TmapSensor, HpfpUpgrade, AftermarketInjectors
- **Safety**: PiSafetyCoilCut, DesensitizeKnock, KnockCel
- **FlexFuel**: Standard, CANBUS ECA, blend maps
- **MultiMap**: ActiveMapSlot, WheelControl

Some options conflict (e.g. BoostPerGear + TorquePerGear). The app validates options before flashing.

## Write Types

- **Map**: Calibration-only (fastest)
- **Long**: Extended calibration region
- **Full**: Full program + calibration (longest; battery charger strongly recommended)

The app detects the appropriate write type from the tune file size.
