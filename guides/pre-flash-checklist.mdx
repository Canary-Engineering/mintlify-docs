## Overview

The app runs 12 pre-flash condition checks before starting a flash. All must pass for the flash to proceed. These conditions were discovered from the flasher RE string table (PPC_01 through PPC_0C).

- **Recommended**: 13.2 V (with battery charger)

For long write types (Full, Long), a battery charger is strongly recommended.

## Running the Check

Before flashing to stock or flashing a tune, the app calls `checkPreFlashConditions()`. Failed conditions are shown with a description. Fix any failures before retrying.
