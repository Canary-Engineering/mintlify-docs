## Read DTCs

1. Open the **Codes** tab
2. Tap **Read Codes**
3. The fault list shows code, description, and severity (warning/critical)

---

## Clear DTCs

1. Open the **Codes** tab
2. Tap **Clear Codes**
3. Confirm. All stored DTCs are cleared.

<Info>
Clearing DTCs does not fix the underlying issue. If a fault persists, the code will return. Address the root cause (sensor, wiring, etc.) before clearing.
</Info>

## Adaptation Resets

Adaptations are learned values the ECU adjusts over time. Resetting forces re-learning, which is recommended after flashing a new tune.

### 12 Adaptation Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Idle | Idle speed control |
| Intake | Intake manifold / airflow |
| Knock regulation | Ignition timing corrections |
| Lambda regulation | O2 sensor regulation |
| Lambda sensors | O2 sensor aging/offset |
| Load control | Requested vs. actual load |
| Throttle | Throttle body position |
| Battery change | Voltage/capacity re-learn |
| Long term fuel trim | LTFT |
| Octane | Knock-based fuel quality learning |
| Rail pressure | Fuel rail target vs. actual |
| VANOS | Variable valve timing |

### Reset Individual or All

- **Reset All**: Clears all 12 adaptation types
- **Reset per type**: Expand the adaptation section and tap reset for specific types

## ECU Identification

The **Codes** tab shows:

- VIN, Engine, Platform
- Flash count, SW version, Calibration ID
- Battery voltage, OBD readiness
- Current map, map slot
