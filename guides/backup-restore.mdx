## Create Backup

A full calibration backup is required before flashing. The backup reads the ECU calibration sector via UDS RequestUpload and TransferData.

1. Open the **Restore** tab in the bottom navigation
2. Tap **Create Backup** and confirm when prompted
3. Wait for completion; do not disconnect during the operation
4. The app stores the backup in its documents directory; the path is shown after completion

<Warning>
Store backups in a safe location. You may need them to restore if a flash fails or to return to stock.
</Warning>

## Restore to Stock

Restore uses your last backup to write the original calibration back to the ECU.

1. Ensure you have a valid backup (created earlier)
2. Open the **Restore** tab
3. Tap **Flash Stock File**
4. The app runs pre-flash checks (battery, ignition, etc.)
5. Confirm and wait for the restore to complete

## Stage 0

Stage 0 resets the ECU to a baseline calibration. Availability and behavior depend on your tune and ECU type. If the option is present, follow the on-screen prompts.
