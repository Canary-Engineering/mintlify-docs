## Connection Failed

**Symptoms**: Red status dot, "Adapter not found", timeout, connection lost mid-operation.

**Possible causes**:
- Adapter not powered or not plugged into OBD port
- Wrong IP/port (default: 192.168.4.1:6801)
- Phone not on adapter's WiFi network (for WiFi adapters)
- Ignition off
- Adapter hardware fault

**Actions**:
1. Check adapter is firmly seated in OBD port
2. Verify phone is connected to adapter WiFi (WiFi adapters)
3. Confirm IP and port in Settings
4. Turn ignition on (engine can be off)
5. Retry connection

## Unknown ROM

**Symptoms**: "Unknown ROM" error when attempting backup or flash.

**Cause**: Your ECU's hardware part number and software version are not in the ROM database.

**Actions**:
1. Read ECU IDs (VIN, HW, SW) via the app or `wifi_read_ecu_id` example
2. The ROM may need to be added to the database
3. Do not use `allow_unknown_rom` unless you understand the risks of cross-architecture writes

## Flash Failed

**Symptoms**: Flash rejects before starting, or fails mid-write.

**Common causes and actions**:

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No backup exists | Create and verify a backup first |
| Backup not verified | Ensure backup completed successfully |
| Pre-flash condition failed | Check battery voltage, ignition, immobilizer |
| Tune size mismatch | Tune file must match ECU calibration size exactly |
| Option not implemented | Some flash options may not be supported for your ROM |
| Checksum mismatch | Verify tune file integrity; retry with a fresh file |

---

## Tune File Errors

**Invalid tune file**: Wrong size, malformed container. Ensure the file is a valid calibration BIN for your ECU (e.g. 192 KB for B58 MG1).

**Tune ECU mismatch**: Tune targets a different engine/ROM than the connected ECU. Use a tune that matches your vehicle.

## Adapter Timeout / Stream Desync

**Symptoms**: Operation hangs, then fails with timeout or stream error.

**Actions**:
1. Ensure stable connection; avoid moving the phone during operations
2. Check for interference (other OBD apps, Bluetooth)
3. Try a different adapter if the issue persists
