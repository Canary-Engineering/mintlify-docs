## Overview

The MHD+ steering wheel menu provides a 3-page interface for runtime ECU configuration. Enter via the BC (Board Computer) or SET/LIM button. The CEL blinks to indicate the current page; the RPM needle shows the selection value.

## Pages

| Page | CEL Pattern | RPM Meaning | Function |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | 1 blink | 1000 = Map 1, 2000 = Map 2, 3000 = Map 3, 4000 = Map 4 | Map switching |
| 2 | 2 blinks | 0 = OEM, 1000 = open, 2000 = closed | Exhaust flap override |
| 3 | 3 blinks | 1000 = 10% E, 7500 = 75% E | Ethanol quick-view (read-only) |

## Interaction Flow

1. **Enter**: Hold BC or SET/LIM for 2 seconds. CEL starts blinking, tach jumps.
2. **Navigate**: Cruise UP/DOWN rocker cycles the selection within the current page.
3. **Change page**: Quick-press BC or SET/LIM. CEL pattern changes (1 → 2 → 3 → 1).
4. **Confirm & exit**: Hold BC or SET/LIM for 2 seconds. Selection applied, CEL stops.

## Page 1: Map Switching

- Select active map slot (1–4).
- RPM needle: 1000 = Map 1, 2000 = Map 2, 3000 = Map 3, 4000 = Map 4.
- Requires multi-map tune and WheelControl flash option.

---

## Page 2: Exhaust Flap

- **OEM** (RPM 0): Stock exhaust flap control.
- **Force open** (RPM 1000): Flap always open.
- **Force closed** (RPM 2000): Flap closed up to load safety threshold.

---

## Page 3: Ethanol View

- Read-only display of ethanol content from CAN ECA sensor.
- RPM needle indicates percentage (e.g. 7500 = 75%).
- Requires FlexFuel with CANBUS ECA.

---

## Requirements

- Tune must include MHD+ calibration extension (MapSwitchBase template).
- WheelControl flash option for steering wheel map switching.
- RAM addresses for live adjustment are ROM-specific; support depends on your tune.
